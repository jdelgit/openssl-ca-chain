## CA certificate
The CA (certificate authority) represent the most trusted party in a certificate chain. This certificate's signature is used to make the other certificates in the chain valid and is the final or technically first entity in the certificate chain. Since the CA is a trusted party they sign their own certificate.

Your OS already trusts many CAs, these CAs are then used to sign the certificates used for the vast majority of the websites on the internet. To see the [list of CAs that your system ](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/97244/list-all-available-ssl-ca-certificates)trusts out of the box you can run the following commands on Linux.

1. Using `awk` and `openssl` on the  `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` system certificate file.
	-  `awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' '/BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
 2. Using `trust` command
	- `trust list | grep label`

Both the above commands show the certificate Subjects. The certificate **Subject** is the owner of the certificate, and the certificate **Issuer** is the trusted party which signed the certificate. For root CAs the Subject and the Issuer are the same party, if it's an intermediate CA then the two fields will differ in value.

In our example we're gonna look at the trust-chain of DigiCert which is one of the larges CAs. Let's start by getting one of their root CAs from our local trust-store. A trust-store is where all the trusted certificates are stored.


### Example using DigiCert.com

#### DigiCert CA
As DigiCert is one of the largest CAs in the world, their CAs are trusted by default on all OS. We can use their trust chain to learn a bit about the whole setup.
Let's start by first decoding and storing the output of `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` to a separate file. We can achieve that with the below snippet.  The output is saved to a file called `list_of_CAs.txt`. Note that the command is slightly different as the one shown above as we want to see the whole certificate content and not just the Subject.

```
# Save list of CAs from trust store file file
awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -text' '/BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt > list_of_CAs.txt
```

Now we can lookup the DigiCert certificates. There are different ones however we'll single out one of them for this session. Among the certificates we'll find one with
`C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2`

in both the **Issuer** and the **Subject** fields as shown below.

	Subject: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2`
	Issuer: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2`

 The signature fields have been left out for the sake of brevity.
```
# DigiCert Global Root G2

            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:TRUE
            X509v3 Key Usage: critical
                Digital Signature, Certificate Sign, CRL Sign
            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:

    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
```

Looking further in the above snippet we see a section called `X509v3 extensions`. One of the fields in that section shows the value `CA:TRUE`, this tells is the the certificate is indeed a CA certificate.

Now let's look at what chain of trust is used on their website  [www.digicert.com](https://www.digicert.com).
We'll use the following command.

`echo "Q" | openssl s_client -connect digicert.com:443`

The port 443 is the default port used for SSL traffic, if we don't specify it the traffic will be directed to port 80 a non-SSL port.

For now let's only have a look at the first to sections of the output.
```
CONNECTED(00000003)

depth=2 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2
verify return:1

depth=1 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, CN = DigiCert EV RSA CA G2
verify return:1

depth=0 jurisdictionC = US, jurisdictionST = Utah, businessCategory = Private Organization, serialNumber = 5299537-0142, C = US, ST = Utah, L = Lehi, O = "DigiCert, Inc.", CN = www.digicert.com
verify return:1
---
```

The first section shows the depth of the provided certificate chain, i.e. how many members  make up the chain.
- depth=0 : The website's server certificate
- depth=1 : The intermediate certificate that signed the server certificate
- depth=2 : The root certificate that signed the intermediate certificate


```
Certificate chain

  i:C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, CN = DigiCert EV RSA CA G2
  a:PKEY: rsaEncryption, 2048 (bit); sigalg: RSA-SHA256
  v:NotBefore: Jul 31 00:00:00 2023 GMT; NotAfter: Jul 30 23:59:59 2024 GMT

  i:C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2
  a:PKEY: rsaEncryption, 2048 (bit); sigalg: RSA-SHA256
  v:NotBefore: Jul  2 12:42:50 2020 GMT; NotAfter: Jul  2 12:42:50 2030 GMT
```

In the second section we see two of the depth levels with additional details showing the Subject and Issuer information.

Website (depth=0):

	Subject : `jurisdictionC = US, jurisdictionST = Utah, businessCategory = Private Organization, serialNumber = 5299537-0142, C = US, ST = Utah, L = Lehi, O = "DigiCert, Inc.", CN = www.digicert.com `
	Issuer: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, CN = DigiCert EV RSA CA G2 `

Intermediate CA (depth=1):

	Subject: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, CN = DigiCert EV RSA CA G2`
	Issuer: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2`

From the Root CA that we took from our system we see

Root CA (depth=2):

	Subject: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2`
	Issuer: `C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2`

With this we can now see that the Subject of the root CA is the Issuer of the intermediate CA certificate, and the Subject of the intermediate  CA is the Issuer of the Website (server) certificate.

We can take this a step further and have a look at the certificates provided by the website.
Run the command
`echo "Q"| openssl s_client -showcerts -connect digicert.com:443 | awk -v RS='-----END CERTIFICATE-----' '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/{print $0 RS}'
The commands appends the encoded certificates to the Certificate chain section and prints out only the sections relevant to us.

We can copy and paste the certificate blocks to a file to inspect it more easily. I've one both in a file called `digicert-web.crt` and the other in `digicert-intermediate.crt`

Let's inspect them with

`openssl x509 -in digicert-intermediate.crt -noout -text`

```

Here we also see `CA:TRUE` even though the Subject and Issuer are not the same, this indicate that it is an intermediate certificate


`openssl x509 -in digicert-web.crt -noout -text`

For the server certificate we see `CA:FALSE` indicating that it's not a CA.
